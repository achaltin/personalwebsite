    <h3>Kappa Phi Delta Sorority</h3>
    <p class="date">January 2016 to Present</p>
    <p class="main">I pledged Kappa Phi Delta Sorority in the Spring of 2016. I joined to find a supportive group of
      women on campus, and that's exactly what I got. My first acitve semester, Fall 2016, I was the Public 
      Relations Chair. I created advertisements for a wide variety of events and mediums, including recruitment events,
      philanthropy or fundraising events, and social events, for print and various social media platforms. <br/>

    </aside>
    <p class="main" ><br/>During 2017, I served as the Secretary. During my term, I focused on improving meeting
      effieiciency and inter-sorority relations. I reformatted our meeting minutes to prioritize the time of our sisters,
      and instituted a schedule to follow, allowing sisters to plan their time more accurately. I also began the <em>Quality 
        Kappa</em> Awards to recognize sisters who portrayed our qualities and values well. <br/><br/>
      For 2018, I am the President of Kappa Phi Delta Sorority. My main goals are policy updates,
      including but not limited to the Bylaws, Standing Rules, Risk Management Policy, Scholarship Policy, and Membership
      Policy. As secretary, I noticed a disconnect from our policies and our values, and I seek to align thoses. I also 
      aim to better our campus relations. I have started inviting IIT Faculty to meals at the Kappa Phi Delta house
      in order for us to get to know them, and to let them see who we are. I hope to improve the perception not only of Kappa,
      but of Greek Life overall at IIT.

        Our executive board terms are year long, starting in January and running from the Srping semester
        to the fall. This is to ease the turnover process and prevent drastic information loss when previous 
        executive board members graduate in the Spring. <br/> <br/>
      <a class="aside" href = "../files/Kappa_Sample_Minutes.pdf">View a sample of my meeting minutes format. </a>
      Only the Business table is discussed out loud, anything in Dates/Announcements is read silently at the beginning 
      of the meeting. I limit Business Discussion to last only until 10:30pm for the health of our sisters.

    <h3>Love to Dance (LTD) Collective</h3>
    <p class="date">August 2015 to Present</p>
    <p class="main">LTD was the very first organization I joined at IIT. I have been dancing since I was four years
      old, and I don't ever intend to stop. My first year, 2015-2016, I was a member, and participated in learning and
      performing a hip hop piece, which we then made into a promo video.

    <p class="main"><br/>My second year, I became the Vice President. LTD is still a young organization, and my
      year as Vice President, I planned and ran our first two events in the Bog at IIT. We performed a group
      dance, and then hosted a dance party for other IIT students.

    <p class="main"><br/>My third year, I became the President, and am currently working on planning our first 
      showcase in the main auditorium. So far, we have four group pieces to perform, and I will be organizing solo
      and small group performers, as well as inviting other groups to join us and perform.

    <h3>Order of Omega</h3>
    <p class="date">January 2017 to Present</p>
    <p class = "main">Order of Omega is a Greek Honor's Society. Members are invited to apply if they are
      in at least their third year, and have a GPA in the top 3% of the Greek Community. They are then selected
      based on campus involvement and philanthropy, and only 15 new members can join each year. I was initiated into 
      the Tau Eta Chapter of Order of Omega my second year, as I had enough credits to be a third year at that time.
      <br/><br/>
      I really value the opportunites for service and philanthropy with Order of Omega. We do at least one major
      service event each semester, usually in the Bronzeville community. I feel it's incredibly important to give
      back to the surrounding community, as opposed to distancing from it. I also enjoy the opportunity to get to engage
      with other like minded Greeks from the campus community.
