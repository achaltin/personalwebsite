      <h3>Web Development | J at School</h3>
      <p class="date">July 2017 to September 2017</p>
      <p class="main">I developed an online training platform for J at School Employees. J at School is a third
        party education company that facilitates Before-School, After-School, Recess, and Enrichment programs at schools
        in Chicago. It is also a subsection of JCC Chicago, a Jewish Culture Corporation. <br/><br/>
        My main job was to transfer their training PowerPoints into a Content Management System called Versal.
        It also involved coding interactive games to maintain attention during the training. I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript
        to create drag and drop category games and ordering games. Unfortunately, the training site is confidential,
        so I cannot share it. 
      </p>
      <aside>I also created a promotional video to introduce the training, <a class="aside" href="https://vimeo.com/230559054">view it here.</a></aside>

      <h3>Marketing Automation Consultant | Robot Cleaner Store</h3>
      <p class="date">July 2017 to September 2017</p>
      <p class="main">I planned and launched an automated marketing campaign for Robot Cleaner Store. I researched
        industry trends, and analyzed customer data for the store in order to create an Instagram marketing campaign,
        and automated the posts to post at ideal points in the day, and the account to automatically generate likes,
        follows, and comments on users with interests similar to current customers. I primarily used a third party 
        software called FollowLiker, but I also created a significant amount of design with HTML and CSS.

      <h3>Teacher's Assistant | Illinois Institute of Technology</h3>
      <p class="date">January 2016 to Present</p>
      <p class="main">I've been working as a Teacher's Assistant for Object Oriented Programming I and II for the
        past four semesters. I love working with students new to coding, and I strive to teach good programming 
        conventions, as well as teamwork. I enforce a pairs-programming model in lab, and have students work in pairs 
        as the "driver" who types, or the "navigator" who instructs the driver, and monitor switching appropriately.

      <h3>Crew Trainer | Oberweis Dairy</h3>
      <p class="date">April 2013 to August 2015</p>
      <p class="main">I worked at Oberweis Dairy from when I turned 16 and could get a job, to when I moved away for college.

      <p class="main">After my second year, I interviewed through the Student Life Leader application process to become a
