The homepage consists of a short "About" Section, giving more details on the coterminal program and myself personally. It also has a link to download my resume, and a webpage friendly version of my resume.

There are 4 other tabs, accessible in the navigation bar at the top:
 -Work Experience, that expands on the industry experience described in my resume, and includes my other experience not related to my degree.
 -Coursework, which goes into detail on the courses I did the most work in, and shows some examples of work I put more than usual effort into. 
 -Campus Involvement, which goes into detail about the Student Organizations I'm in, what I get out of them, and the changes I've made in leadership roles
 -Volunteer Work, which explains the volunteering endeavors I'm most passionate about. 

 Given more time to work on this website (which I intend to do over the summer), I would have liked to make the site more interactive. I attempted an email form, which didn't work, but I found some PHP resources that I can study with more time. I also tried to make the images expand when clicked on, but that also needs a scripting language, more than CSS. 
 
 I also would like to figure out the bugs that make it look different in Mozilla Firefox than the other browsers I tried (Chrome, Edge, and Safari). Lastly, I implemented columns with floating sections, but to make the headings stay above it, I used line breaks or horizontal rulings, and I'd like to find ways to create columns without those, as they do not semantically make sense.
