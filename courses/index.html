    <h3>SCI 522: Public Engagement for Scientists</h3>
    <p class="main">Public Engagement for Scientists is my first graduate course in pursuit of my Data Science Master's. 
      We focus on learning how to present our science in a way that is digestible and engaging to the public. For example, 
      for class, we worked on entries for the "Flame Challenge," an international competition to answer a scientific question
      for 11-year-olds. I loved the work I was able to do, and chose to enter my work into the competition. The reception 
      of my video was mixed, many students found it to be off-topic, which is true. However, a good portion really liked
      a different focus, and the use of technology to change our behaviors. Should I enter the Flame Challenge in the future,
      of my own accord as opposed to a class assignment, I'd of course spend more than the week we had to work on it, and
      invest in better software and equipment. I'd also likely not enter in a topic I'm not passionate about. Creating this video
      was very challenging for me, since I'm not a climate scientist, and my passion very much lies behind a screen. <br/><br/>
      We also expanded our Flame Challenge ideas to work on communicating science to peers who are not necessarily scientists.
      We put together a website to showcase our work for all audiences. I created a video to boost the site, which is featured on
      the landing page. I also created a <a href=http://scienceiseverything.printobject.com/2018/04/22/lets-change-the-curve/ class="page" target="_blank">
      Climate Infograpic</a> targeted at young adults.

    <h3>CS 425: Database Organization</h3>
    <p class="main">
      In Database Organization, we focused on traditional relational databases. For our semester long project,
      we were tasked to work in groups to create a database driven web application. The only requirement was to 
      use a relational database, and have logon privileges for at least three different user roles.
      <br/><br>
      My team chose to create a mySQL database following our ERD Schema, and create an interface primarily with php.
      We were able to create a system that allowed a user to create an account, create products to sell, and purchase 
      other products. This involved loading 'money' into the accounts, and managing their 'wallet' to deduct the appropriate
      amounts, as well as keeping track of quanitities of products to ensure that orders were valid.

    <h3>CS 351: Systems Programming</h3>
    <p class = "main">For this course, we focused heavily on understanding and implementing functions of a 
      Computer System. The most memberable projects were simulators for a Shell, Cache, and Dynamic Memory Allocator.
    </p>
    <h4 class="main">Shell Simulator</h4>
    <p class="main">We were tasked with creating a shell simulator that functioned like existing Linux shells.
      I worked to create a REPL that could handle foreground and background processes, and provide abstraction for system calls.
    </p>
    <h4 class="main">Cache Simulator</h4>
    <p class="main">I created a program that would take instructions for memory (load, store, or modify),
      parse the address, and determine whether the instruction caused a hit or miss. I then created a program to 
      test the efficiency of the cache, and optimize utilization in a matrix multiplication problem. 
    </p>
    <h4 class="main">Dynamic Memory Allocator Simulator</h4>
    <p class = "main"> 
      The DMA simulator is by far the most challenging project I have ever completed. I simulated the heap
      in memory without using any existing memory functions (like malloc(), free(), or sbrk()). What helped me
      incredibly in this project was the use of macros in C, not only for many of the function defintions to manage
      addresses, heap headers, and heap footers, but also to debug without slowing down the runtime efficiency.
