      <h3>Sarah's Circle</h3>
      <p class="date">August 2017 to Present</p>
      <p class="main">
        Sarah's Circle is Kappa Phi Delta Sorority's Philanthropy Partner. We volunteer with them at least
        once per semester, and participate in their Winter Walk each year. Sarah's Circle is a local resource for
        Chicago women who are homeless or in need. What is particularly unique about Sarah's Circle is that it
        targets adult, single women, which is surprisingly rare. I love being able to fundraise and know that we're
        helping amazing women, and I love being able to see our impact on a regular basis.

      <h3>Alternative Spring Break</h3>
      <p class="date">August 2016-May 2017</p>
      <p class="main">
        My second year, I joined the student organization Alternative Spring Break (ASB). We spent most of the 
        year fundrasing and volunteering, and during Spring Break, used our funding to go on a trip to Taos, New
        Mexico. We volunteered on a build site for an Adobe House with Habitat for Humanity each day throughout Spring
        Break. It was a very rewarding experience to work on a home for a family in need, and valuable in that I learned 
        a lot about how to use tools.

      <h3>PAWS Chicago</h3>
      <p class="date">August 2016-May 2017</p>
      <p class="main">
        PAWS Chicago is a nonprofit animal shelter dedicated to creating a no-kill Chicago. This means that they are
        attempting to save all animals, whether or not they can be adopted. I volunteered at the PAWS Medical Center my 
        second year of college on a weekly basis. I worked with the cats, since I love cats, and everyone else always 
        picks dogs. <br/><br/>I got the opportunity to work very closely with the staff and the animals, since I was almost always
        the only volunteer working with cats. I particularly enjoyed socializing feral kittens, but greatly admired their
        community cat program. Older volunteers with cars drive out and humanely capture stray cats that are not dangerous,
        and we care for them while they are neutered or spayed, and then they are returned to their community, where they
        can mind their own business and not have any stray kittens.

      <h3>Elmhurst Public Library</h3>
      <p class="date">2008-2015</p>
      <p class = "main">Every summer from 5th grade until high school, I volunteered at the Elmhurst Public Library
        for their Summer Reading Program. I have always loved reading, and libraries, and I think this was the opportunity
        that made me realize how much I love volunteering. Over the several summers, I worked at the front desk awarding
        prizes for reaching reading milestones, worked with kindergarteners to develope their reading comprehension,
        and worked with Library Administration.

      <h3>Remarkable Women's Conference</h3>
      <p class="date">September 17, 2017</p>
      <p class="main">On September 17, 2017, a conference was held at the Illinois College of Optometry to promote
        Black Female Entrepreuners. I volunteered to help with setup and support throughout the event, and also got
        the opportunity to listen to many of the speakers.
