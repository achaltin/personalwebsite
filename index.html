  <h4>About my Degree</h4>
  <p>The Illinois Institute of Technology offers a program called the Coterminal Program. This means that
     I am simultaneously pursuing both a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and a Master's of Applied
	 Science in Data Science, and will graduate with both degrees in 2020. The trick to this degree is postponing 
	 graduation in order to hold on to undergraduate aid, and overlap a few classes in both degrees  to save time.</p>
  <h4>About Me</h4>
  <p>I'm originally from Elmhurst, IL, which is a west suburb of Chicago. I decided to attend the Illinois Institute of
    Technology since it is close to home, and has lots of opportunities for leadership development. I originally interviewed 
	for the Camras Scholars Program as a Biomedical Engineering Major, and was accepted into the scholarship. In my second year,
	I realized I was much more passionate about Computer Science, having picked up a minor in it to supplement my Medical Imaging
	specialty, so I switched. I decided to pursue the Data Science Coterminal program due to my enjoyment of my Probability and Statistics
	class. I'm excited to gain more experience in all aspects of my degrees. <p>
