      <h3>Crew Trainer | Oberweis Dairy</h3>
      <p class="date">April 2013 to August 2015</p>
      <p class="main">I worked at Oberweis Dairy from when I turned 16 and could get a job, to when I moved away for college.
        I progressed through the roles, learning how to make the recipes, customer service techniques, operating the register and
        counting cash, and finally got to Crew Trainer. As a trainer, I was responsible for teaching all aspects of 
        the job to new employees, and performing progress checks on all employees each week. I also had the opportunity to 
        attend leadership development workshops with corporate.

      <h3>SOAR Leader | Illinois Institute of Technology</h3>
      <p class="date">May 2017 to December 2017</p>
      <p class="main">After my second year, I interviewed through the Student Life Leader application process to become a 
        Summer Orientation, Advising, and Registration (SOAR) Leader. During the summer, I received several days of
        training about the various campus resources available, and led groups at 8 overnight orientation sessions. Our 
        mission statement was: </p>

        <blockquote class="main">To create relationships and friendships by having intentional and goal-oriented interactions 
          with new students and guests that not only serves as a catalyst for growth but also inspiration to achieve 
          their goals.
        </blockquote>
        <p class="main">
        I greatly enjoyed getting to be the first point of contact with students of the incoming class, and I feel the 
        opportunity helped me gain a much better understanding of the university.

    <h3>Student Assistant | IIT One Stop</h3>
    <p class="date">December 2017 to Present</p>
    <p class="main">Starting this semester, I work at the One Stop. The One Stop acts as a filter for all questions about IIT.
      Either I can answer it, or I can direct the question to the right person. My duties include purchasing orders 
      for student organizations, checking them in and distributing them once they arrive, managing questions for student
      organization leaders, and connecting students to the Registrar's Office and Student Affairs Office directly.
